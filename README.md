# PriceKeep

## What it does
Fetch products from supermarket websites, compare and show


# Technology stack

### Frontend: 
- TypeScript/vue.js
- Shadcn/vue for the UI library

### Backend:
- Java 24
- Quarkus (w/Hibernate ORM)
- PostgreSQL + PostGIS plugin (Data storage and location)
- Microsoft Playwright (For web scraping)
- MapStruct (Object mapping)
- Go 1.25 (for [fingerprint proxy](https://github.com/victpork/pineproxy/))

## Requirements for running dev environment locally
You'll need the following items pre-installed before starting
- Docker/Podman (For the devcontainers PostgreSQL/Proxy)
- NodeJS/pnpm

## Starting the dev environment

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

```shell script
./gradlew quarkusDev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at <http://localhost:8080/q/dev/>.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:

```shell script
./gradlew build
```

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `build/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `build/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar build/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:

```shell script
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.jar.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar build/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using:

```shell script
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.native.enabled=true
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using:

```shell script
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.native.enabled=true -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./build/pricekeep-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult <https://quarkus.io/guides/gradle-tooling>.
